# APF Finance System to Payments Server
This document can be used along with the sample C# program:
	[PROACTIS.AcceleratedPayments.Web.ExampleBuyerAPIClient](https://github.com/proactis-documentation/exampleapplications)

This document is only concerned with the integrations between the Finance System and the Payments Server.
Currently there is only one integration between these two systems which is the flow of supplier details from the finance system to the payment server.

### Authentication
All API calls require the username and password be supplied in a base64 encoded format in the Authorisation header of the request.
In C# the code for doing this would look like the following:
```C#
credentials = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(USER + ":" + PASSWORD));
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Basic " + credentials);
```
For example
 

If the details are incorrect then the site will respond with a 401 error
 

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
When the user agent wants to send the server authentication credentials it may use the Authorization field.
The Authorization field is constructed as follows: 

1 The username and password are combined with a single colon.  
2 The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence.   
3 The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64.   
4 The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.  
For example, if the browser uses Aladdin as the username and OpenSesame as the password, then the field's value is the b

ase64-encoding of Aladdin:OpenSesame, or QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l. 
Then the Authorization header will appear as:
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
