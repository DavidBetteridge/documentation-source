# Custom Imaging DLLs

## Overview
The PROACTIS P2P product has been designed so that it can be easily integrated with a number of different Document Management Systems (DMS).

A typical PROACTIS imaging solution requires the following integration points:-

1.	The scanned image needs to be associated with an invoice within PROACTIS.
2.	Users need to be able to see the original scanned image by clicking a link within the PROACTIS web site.

Although there are many different possible methods available (as different DMS and customers have different requirements) a generic imaging DLL has been written which meets the majority of customerâ€™s requirements.

For the cases where neither the built-in PROACTIS imaging solution or the Generic Imaging DLLs meet your requirements a completely custom DLL can be written.

<grs:DocumentType>I</grs:DocumentType>
<grs:DocumentGUID>{D79D1EE8-4B87-414B-8512-92590DFBE2E8</grs:DocumentGUID>
<grs:ImageNumber>0</grs:ImageNumber>
<grs:CompanyGUID>{A2FEEDC5-978F-11D5-8C5E-0001021ABF9B</grs:CompanyGUID>
